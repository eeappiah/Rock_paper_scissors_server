# Rock_paper_scissors_server
Project done in python which was lead from the Server client project to further understand how a built server can be used within an example. 

Note: In order for this to work, you will need the local IP address of your network in-order to use this project.
Within the network.py file and server.py file, IP variable is stored so will need to adjust to whatever network you are on.
